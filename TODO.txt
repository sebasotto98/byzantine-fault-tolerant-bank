Stage 2 functions:

	Steps (recommend in instructions):
		- replicate server N times. Clients loop and send request to the N servers
		- Implement Byzantine Regular Register (section 4.7 of book)
		- Transform Byzantine Regular Register into Byzantine Atomic Register
		- Reason on what could happen if clients are malicious and protect if needed
		- dependability tests


	- Parallelize bank to allow multiple server replicas as (1,N) Byzantine Atomic registers
	- Protect against DoS attacks
	
Other:
	- Make sequence number persistent and unique to each user
	- Store past signatures
	- Check that CSV file modification is secure
	- Allow connection to bank from clients in different machines
	- Alter script to receive names as arguments
	- Receive bank name as argument
	- Refactor to be more modular???
	- Complete API and Bank unit tests
